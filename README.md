# Discord-Img-Bot
A discord bot made using python which uses web scraping to provide a random image of a user input.

The bot uses web scraping to scrape google images and display a random image to the user based on the input given by the user. Response times vary based on the input and internet connectivity. Faster response times and more updates to come in the future. The bot is currently hosted locally and will be shifted to the cloud once it gains enough support.
